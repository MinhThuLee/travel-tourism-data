### a. Revenue in 2024 is higher than in 2023 — so did the company make a profit in 2024 and how does it compare to 2023?
Step 1: Calculate the measure `Total_cost`  
Step 2: Calculate `Profit` and `Profit LY`  
- Using a clustered column chart shows that revenue in 2024 > costs in 2024 => so the company still made a profit in 2024. In 2025, profit is negative.
- Using a clustered column chart shows profit in 2024 > 2025 and profit in 2024 > 2023 => this proves that 2024 made more profit than 2023.
 
### b. Why does profit in 2025 not follow the trend of the previous two years?  
- Using a clustered column chart Revenue vs Cost => Cost in 2025 > Revenue in 2025. The costs in 2025 are too high while revenue is low, leading to profit not following the trend of the previous two years.

- The tour generating the highest profit, highest revenue, and most crowded customer volume is Da Nang - Toronto (6 days). Therefore, actions are needed to market this tour to reach more customers in the coming year.
- The top 2 and 3 tours in terms of revenue and customer volume are Da Nang - HCMC (7 days) and HCMC - Singapore (8 days). However, the profit margin of the Singapore tour is higher despite lower revenue, so the company needs to implement policies to up-sell this tour further.

Meanwhile, customers traveling from Da Nang to Toronto for 6 days generate significant extra service revenue. Customers from HCMC to Phu Quoc, the Mekong Delta, or Paris will spend more on extra services beyond the base tour if they choose a 5–6 day tour.
